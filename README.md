This is the final project for EC527: High Performance Computing. Our goal is to make Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) faster. This project will allow use to demonstrate our knowledge in high performance computing by exploiting single-thread optimizations, multithreading, and GPU computing to speed up FFT.
