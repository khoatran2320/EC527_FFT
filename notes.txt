Butterfly effect
	
	8 inputs, x[0] through x[7]
	8 outputs, X[0] through X[7]

	x[0] and x[1] 
	x[2] and x[3]

	x[0] and x[0]




1. Do 1D fft on matrix row by row (m)
2. Do transpose of matrix, 
3. Do 1D FFT on transpose
4. Transpose back 


For each row, shift numbers around inside row

Bit-reversing to shift

Levels 2, 4, and 8

How many levels tell you how many bits there are


Ex. 1024, 2^10, ten levels, 11 binary 

	for (temp = n; temp > 1U; temp >>= 1)
		levels++;

(j > i) swap 1 to 4, don't want to repeat and swap 4 to 1
